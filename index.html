    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>
        In my home country, <em>Mexico</em>, food plays an essential role in the life our people, so much that when you get home the first thing you
        will be asked will often be "¿Ya comiste?" which literally means, "Did you eat?", but conveys a deeper meaning of concern and care...
        or maybe it is just something we learnt from our parents.

        As in Mexico, food plays an important role in many Asian countries. You might have heard
        <a href="https://asiasociety.org/korea/bab-meogeosseoyo-bap-meogeosseoyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"밥 먹었어 (Bap meogeosseo)?"</a> for
        example, if you are into K-drama. This phrase also translates as "did you eat?", but it is often used between friends and family as greeting.
