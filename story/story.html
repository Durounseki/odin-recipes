        <p>
            In my home country, <em>Mexico</em>, food plays an essential role in the lives of our people, so much that when you get home the first thing you
            will be asked will often be "¿Ya comiste?" which literally means, "Did you eat?", but conveys a deeper meaning of concern and care...
            or maybe it is just something we learnt from our parents.
        </p>

            As in Mexico, food plays an important role in many Asian countries. You might have heard
            <a href="https://asiasociety.org/korea/bab-meogeosseoyo-bap-meogeosseoyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"밥 먹었어 (Bap meogeosseo)?"</a> for
            example (even if you are not into K-drama). This phrase also translates as "did you eat?", but it is often used between friends and family as greeting.
