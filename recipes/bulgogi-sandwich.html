            <h1>Bulgogi Sandwich</h1>
            <p>
                This mouthwatering beef sandwich was inspired by the famous <a href="./bibimbap.html">Bibimbap</a>, a korean comfort food consisting of rice, mixed veggies, either sweet soy sauce marinated beef or a spicy pork
                and a variety of extra toppings such as gim, and obviously tons of kimchi. For this recipe I chose to combine the flavors of the sweet beef and the spicy pork for the main protein.
                For the toppings I added some lettuce, cucumber and carrots. For the toppings I went for the classic Nappa cabage kimchi and a very special treat, <a href="./mayak-gyeran.html">Mayak Gyeran</a>
                or as some of us call them <em>drug eggs</em>. You definitely have to try, here is how to make it.
